1. Failed to capture fingerprint of output files for task ':app:processDebugResources' property 'sourceOutputDir' during up-to-date check

```
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

2. Android dependency 'androidx.core:core' has different version for the compile (1.0.0) and runtime (1.0.1) classpath. You should manually set the same version via DependencyResolution
